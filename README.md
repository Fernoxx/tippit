## 🚀 **Monorepo Structure**

This repository contains both frontend and backend in a single repo for easier deployment and management.

├── backend-only/           # Backend (Express.js)

## 🏗️ **Deployment**

### **Railway (Recommended - Full Stack)**
1. Connect this repo to Railway
2. Railway automatically runs `build.sh` to build frontend + backend
3. Starts backend server which also serves frontend static files
4. Single domain for everything: `your-app.railway.app`

### **Separate Deployment (Current)**
- Frontend: Vercel (`ecion.vercel.app`)
