# Farcaster Mini App Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Create Hosted Manifest (Easy Method)

1. **Visit the Farcaster Developer Tools**: https://farcaster.xyz/~/developers/mini-apps/manifest

2. **Fill in your app details**:
   ```
   Domain: ecion.vercel.app (or your custom domain)
   App Name: Ecion
   Description: Tip your audience for engagement on Farcaster
   Category: social
   Tags: tipping, rewards, engagement, farcaster
   
   Icon URL: https://ecion.vercel.app/icon.png
   Home URL: https://ecion.vercel.app
   Splash Image: https://ecion.vercel.app/splash.png
   Screenshots: Add 2-3 screenshots of your app
   
   Required Capabilities:
   - actions.signIn
   - wallet.getEthereumProvider
   - wallet.switchChain
   ```

3. **Get your Hosted Manifest ID** (e.g., `1234567890`)

4. **Update the redirect URLs**:
   - Replace `PLACEHOLDER_MANIFEST_ID` in `next.config.js` with your actual ID
   - Replace `PLACEHOLDER_MANIFEST_ID` in `backend-only/src/index.js` with your actual ID

### 2. Alternative: Manual Manifest File

If you prefer to manage the manifest yourself, create `public/.well-known/farcaster.json`:

```json
{
  "miniapp": {
    "version": "1",
    "name": "Ecion",
    "iconUrl": "https://ecion.vercel.app/icon.png",
    "homeUrl": "https://ecion.vercel.app",
    "imageUrl": "https://ecion.vercel.app/og-image.png",
    "buttonTitle": "ðŸ’° Start Tipping",
    "splashImageUrl": "https://ecion.vercel.app/splash.png",
    "splashBackgroundColor": "#fef3c7",
    "requiredChains": ["eip155:8453"],
    "requiredCapabilities": [
      "actions.signIn",
      "wallet.getEthereumProvider",
      "wallet.switchChain"
    ],
    "subtitle": "Tip your audience for engagement",
    "description": "Boost your casts by tipping engagers for their interactions on Farcaster.",
    "primaryCategory": "social",
    "tags": ["tipping", "rewards", "engagement", "farcaster"],
    "ogTitle": "Ecion - Tip Your Audience",
    "ogDescription": "Boost your casts by tipping engagers for their interactions on Farcaster.",
    "ogImageUrl": "https://ecion.vercel.app/og-image.png"
  }
}
```

### 3. Domain Verification

1. **Choose your domain**: Use `ecion.vercel.app` (your current Vercel deployment)
2. **Verify ownership**: The manifest will be automatically verified when you deploy
3. **Test the manifest**: Visit `https://ecion.vercel.app/.well-known/farcaster.json`

### 4. Deploy and Test

1. **Deploy your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Farcaster Mini App manifest support"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Test the manifest**:
   - Visit: `https://ecion.vercel.app/.well-known/farcaster.json`
   - Should redirect to your hosted manifest or show the JSON

3. **Submit to Farcaster**:
   - Your app will be discoverable in Farcaster Mini App stores
   - Users can find it by searching for "Ecion" or "tipping"
