# ECION Token Description

ECION is an engager coin that automatically tips every engager and tipper who uses our app by simply holding it.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Rewards**: Holders of ECION tokens automatically receive rewards when they engage with content or tip others through the Ecion platform
- **Engagement-Based**: The more ECION tokens you hold, the more rewards you earn for your engagement activities
- **Seamless Integration**: Works automatically in the background - no additional actions required beyond holding the token
- **Reward Multiplier**: Your reward amount scales with your token holdings (e.g., 1M+ tokens = 10 ECION per tip, 2M+ = 20 ECION, etc.)

## How It Works

1. **Hold ECION Tokens**: Simply hold ECION tokens in your wallet
2. **Engage & Tip**: Use the Ecion app to engage with content (likes, recasts, replies) or tip creators
3. **Automatic Rewards**: The system automatically detects your token holdings and rewards both you (the tipper) and the content creator (engager) with ECION tokens based on your holdings
